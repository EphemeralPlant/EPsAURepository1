		<h1>Oh, hello there!</h1>

		I didn’t expect you’d find this repository, but I’ll be using this website as a reserve for any OSTs I’m gonna include in <br/>

		the AUs I post on AO3. Just so ‘ya know: These aren’t mine. I’ll indicate if I actually made them, but rarely you’ll find <br/>

		music made by me, so I’ll just be using some, hehe~. I’ll be putting up sites where you can find them, so if ever you’re <br/>

		interested in listening to them, the links will be right up there with the videos. Enjoy, I guess?
